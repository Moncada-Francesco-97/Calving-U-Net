In this directory is stored the code we used to create, train and test a Convolutional Network u-net architecture, with the implementation of attention blocks. All those operation were made on the prepared dataset. The code is structured to train 5 different models, which train on 5 different subsets of the training set derived by cross-validation procedure. The training dataset was divided according to the block strategy recomanded by [Roberts, 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311523792_Cross-validation_strategies_for_data_with_temporal_spatial_hierarchical_or_phylogenetic_structure), and we decided to opt for a temporal division (we kept aside as a testing dataset 2 years for each ice shelf), but the in the [functions_architecture.py](functions_architecture.py) is stored also a function to divide dataset to preserve spatial variability.

In [functions_architecture.py](functions_architecture.py) are stored the functions used to properly load the dataset, the implementation of the personalised loss function, which is based on (dice loss)[https://dev.to/_aadidev/3-common-loss-functions-for-image-segmentation-545o] function, and the architecture of the model itself.

In [u_net.py](u_net.py) is performed cross validation, training and  model initialisation. In this file is possible to set all model hyper-parameters.
